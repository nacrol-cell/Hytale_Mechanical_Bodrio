ISSUE:

the portals cant be broken as of  03/02/2026, that was unintentional, so i recommend that when you got 1 tier of portal, go to creative, get the portal and replace him again to reload the boss. The gameplay was that you got one portal, and then break it and replace
to fight the boss as much as you want to farm items, but well, it seems the mod was bodrio after all...
also the cost to make the armor and weapon seems pretty unbalanced because of the low cost of the gems.
The mod was made in one day because of technical issues i got so expect rough gameplay
